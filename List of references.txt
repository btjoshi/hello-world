Day 2 - 24 Nov 2019

Around 6 hours - it sometime gets tricky with need for facetime with family...

https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-tutorials-home/
Looked cool enough with simpple-feeling short tutorials
Also has real life ML datasets - seems lika a good place to get hold of realistic projects

Day 3 - 25 Nov 2019

1.5 hours - after sifting through many tutorials and webpages, made an investment - purchased all the e-bools from Jason Brownlee. His practical building in Python coding through each of these 'play book' is probably what I was searching for.

Day 4 - 26 Nov 2019

1.5 hours - Read through chapters 1 - 7 of probability_for_machine_learning. Bit east as it is my core professional concept! What I need is to focus on getting Python practice..

Day 5 - 27 Nov 2019 

0.5 hours - Office caught up. Managing large team has its own challenges, sometimes begins to feel hollow.

Day 6 - 28 Nov 2019

2 hours - Chapters 8 - 10 of probability_for_machine_learning. 'Deliberate Practice' is hard!!

Day 7 - 29 Nov 2019

1.5 hours - worked on writing the distribution codes in Jupyter, upto chapter 9. Seems intersting. Realized it is the very act of writing down the codes that is important to get this as Zen. As against always feeling inadequate because simple codes doesnt' come naturally after first reading.

Day 8 - 30 Nov 2019

PU = 20
about 5 hours - good progress! Worked through upto chapter 15. A perspective change that coding now itself is kind of meditation is hard to remember. Like any other meditation I guess.

Day 9 - 1 Dec 2019

about 6 hours - Another solid day - completed noting down upto chapter 18. Need to digest this a bit. Exported my own Jupyter notebook note as html for revision. In the meantime, coming week is lots of hectic.. if I get good an hour a day should be an achivement! Equanimity! Equanimity!! 

Also brought up Mastering ML by Ted Petrou - need to get on with regular practice. The book  robability_for_machine_learning is good. But leaning on theory only may not be ideal. 

Day 10 - 2 Dec 2019

Office caught up. Coming two weeks are going to be hectic, with 14 to 16 hours engagement.
Learnt the concept of data exploration - seems obvious but somehow not appreciated well.

Day 11, 12 and 13 - 3, 4 and 5 Dec - No chance of study! :(

Day 14 - 6 Dec limping back to normalcy. Humble bundle book helping get better sence of Baysian statistics. 

Day 15 - 7 Dec 19 about 4 hours. Coding Zen is not easy. It the same feeling with any other effort with meditation. What seems to be at core is inability to persisit with any desciplined pattern. Is it basic FOMO? 

Day 16 - 8 Dec 19 Sunday - spent time on travelling to Chennai. On a hindsight, flying would have been easier, it is a lofty ambition to lessen carbon footprint, but overall Chennai off-site was bit strange. 

What could I have differently? - Could have used bit of reading through, rather than gossiping

Day 17 - 9 Dec 19 - No way could have studied, or rather did I want this Zen badly enough? Like other meditation and things that are on to do list, things fail of there is no strong desire.

Day 18 - 10 Dec 19 - What matters is a holistic approach. Coding zen, if it is to evolve as as way of Zen, looks like needs supplementing by way of being mindful too. Mindfull of talking more than required, emotions flaring up on imaginary slights, not being able to step aside and watch basic drivesemerge to take control..... long way to go..
