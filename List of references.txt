Day 3 - 25 Nov 2019

1.5 hours - after sifting through many tutorials and webpages, made an investment - purchased all the e-bools from Jason Brownlee. His practical building in Python coding through each of these 'play book' is probably what I was searching for.

Day 4 - 26 Nov 2019

1.5 hours - Read through chapters 1 - 7 of probability_for_machine_learning. Bit east as it is my core professional concept! What I need is to focus on getting Python practice..

Day 5 - 27 Nov 2019 

0.5 hours - Office caught up. Managing large team has its own challenges, sometimes begins to feel hollow.

Day 6 - 28 Nov 2019

2 hours - Chapters 8 - 10 of probability_for_machine_learning. 'Deliberate Practice' is hard!!
