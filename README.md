Beginning of coding journey

Needed some organized way of learning coding when I am starting at age 48! Logging in my joirney might help someone! I intend use this as place where I record my progress, copy the links and materials I use for learning.

It feels overwhelming when one tries to begin. And even after spending good four to six months halfhearted jab it still feels overwhelming. Partly because I have full time at senior management job, 20 teams and about 100 people, and about couple dozen stakeholders. Partly because of age?

What am I trying to do? Log my 10,000 hours of deliberate on mastering coding. Why? Two reasons. Want to be part of what I sense is biggest wave of innovation for humans. The other reason is finding my Zen in this. After having made career and descent senior job, the lure of money and fame is way lesser in what I do for living. Ever since I became adult have tried meditation and explored being in the presence, never getting a good hook really. Coding seems to have that hook, why not make this as a way of living-in-presence?

Current status - A novice, have gone through two or three books introducing Python, almost completed Andrew NG’s machine learning course on course-era, half done some of the courses in Udemy, good part of Master Data Analysis with Python by Ted Pertou.  It seems reasonable to continue to focus on developing theoretical knowledge and add more actual coding on the way. 

How long this takes? At 20 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, might as well take good 10 years. Not a bad target considering 10 hours spent on commuting for 5 days week work! But then they need to be not just hours spent, but ‘deliberate’ practice! 

And Jupyter notebooks are kind of records or code repository for my own reference!
