Beginning of coding journey

Needed some organized way of learning coding when I am starting at age 48! Logging in my joirney might help someone! I intend use this as place where I record my progress, copy the links and materials I use for learning.

And also may be some philosophical thoughts that accompany any the hard times faced in any learning!
