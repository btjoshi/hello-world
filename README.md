Beginning of coding journey

Needed some organized way of learning coding when I am starting at age 48! Logging in my joirney might help someone! I intend use this as place where I record my progress, copy the links and materials I use for learning.

And also may be some philosophical thoughts that accompany any the hard times faced in any learning!

The references file is where I am documenting daily progress (hopefully!) and adding the references that I find useful.

Jupyter note books are my own code repository - bits and snippets that can be referred quickly in future.
